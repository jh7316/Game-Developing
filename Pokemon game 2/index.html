    <h1>Assignment 3, Game created by Chloe Han</h1>

  <body>
    <p><b>Hey!</b> I'm Chloe, and I'm currently a student in College of Arts and Sciences at NYU. <br>
    This is my game website, which I made to introduce the game that was made entirely by myself. <br>
    It is a simple shooting game, where you move the pointer to aim and remove gastlies that are trying to attack the village of stuffuls.<br>
    It did not take long for me to come up with this theme since I am a huge fan of pokemon.<br>
    Although it is a simple game, I'm sure you're gonna enjoy it!</p>

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>How to play</h2>

    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>A group of wild gastlies are approaching the village of stuffuls to attack them. Your job is to shoo them away using a weapon called "pokegun". It doesn't kill them, but it scares them away.</li>
      <li>You need to aim for the gastlies and give them a shot. You can move your aim using W,A,S,D keys, and shot by pressing the space bar.</li>
      <li>You can keep pressing on your space bar if you want to get rid of them more efficiently.</li>
      <li>W:up A:left  S:down D:right</li>
      <li>You have 5 lives. If you let a gastly approach the village, you will lose one life. If you lose all 5 lives, you have failed to protect the village and so game is over.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
