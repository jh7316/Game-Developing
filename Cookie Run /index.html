    <title>PRINCESS RUN </title>
    <h1>Midterm project, Game created by Chloe Han</h1>

    <p><b>Hey!</b>
    This is the website for my midterm project, the <b>"Princess Run"</b>. <br>

    <h2>Introduction..</h2>
    Princess Run is a 2D running game, where the princess avoids obstacles(enemies) to reach the goal and save the prince. <br>
    The overall theme of the game is a princess going on an adventure to save the prince in danger,
     which would be a plot twist of the typical theme where the prince reaches out to save the princess. <br>
    The princess will face various obstacles(enemies) during her adventure, and she will either attack or avoid the enemies to proceed.
    <br><br>

    <h2>Motivation & Development..</h2>
    This style of the game is largely motivated by the Korean mobile game <b>"Cookie Run"</b>,
    which is a game where a cookie(playable character) proceeds and earns points by obtaining jellies and avoiding obstacles.<br><br>
    <br>
    Then, the game is added originality with more complex settings. There will be 3 types of enemies: physical, magical and spiritual.<br>
    The princess needs to be in a specific state in order to be able to attack and beat off each type of enemies;
    for example, the princess needs to become a wizard in order to attack magical enemies, and while she's being a wizard, she cannot attack other types of enemies so she has to avoid them in order to proceed.
    She can transform into a specific state by obtaining an item.<br>
    This applies to other states, which are the knight(for physical enemies) and the ghost bride(for spiritual enemies).<br>


    <h2>Instructions:</h2>

    Although it is a simple game, I'm sure you're gonna enjoy it!</p>
